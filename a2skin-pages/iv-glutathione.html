								<strong>Intravenous Glutathione</strong></h4><hr />
								<p>Glutathione is a master antioxidant, an important defense against diseases, toxins, viruses, pollutants, radiation and oxidative stress. Low glutathione levels are linked to diseases such as Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, AIDS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Atherosclerosis, pregnancy complications, male infertility and Cataracts. A Glutathione deficiency can cause a lack of coordination, mental disorders, tremors, and difficulty maintaining balance. Glutathione is continuously defending our body against attacks from disease, toxins, poisons, viruses, pollutants, radiation and oxidative stress. Without Glutathione our liver would soon become overwhelmed with the accumulation of toxins, resulting in organ failure and death.</p>
								<p>You may or may not have heard of glutathione, even though over tens of thousands of medical articles have highlighted its importance. Optimizing glutathione levels will shortly join the list of factors known by everyone to have an impact on our health and well-being. Glutathione is a small protein produced naturally in every cell of our body. It is made up of three protein building blocks, called amino acids. These are cysteine, glyceine, & glutamic acid. Your body produces glutathione inside every cell of your body, or that cell would quickly die. The levels of glutathione produced naturally, is enough to keep the body working optimally under 'normal' conditions. Increasing levels of environmental pollutants and prolonged exposure to stress are depleting your body's stores of glutathione increasingly fast.</p>
								<p>The level of Glutathione in our cells is predictive of how long we will live. We need this miraculous antioxidant to survive, and without it, our liver would soon become overwhelmed with the accumulation of toxins, resulting in organ failure and death. Glutathione is manufactured by every one of our trillions of cells and is one of the most important healing and cleansing agents. Low glutathione levels are linked to diseases such as Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, AIDS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Atherosclerosis, pregnancy complications, male infertility and Cataracts. The liver uses glutathione to process alcohol, caffeine, medications, nicotine and among other substances and remove them from the blood. It also helps in the filtering of alcohol and other toxic substances from the blood. It helps in the processing of drugs and medications absorbed through the digestive system, enabling the body to use them effectively and ultimately dispose of them. Reduced glutathione plays a critical role in the cellular detoxification processes including the metabolism of peroxides, the conjugation with electrophils and the scavenging of the free radicals. The relevance of glutathione in ethanol metabolism consists mainly in compensating for alcohol-related oxidative stress. Glutathione acts as a detoxifying agent by combining with undesirable substances and ridding the body of them through urine and bile.</p>
								<p>White blood cells are the body's major defense system. They need glutathione in order to optimize their function.  By raising the levels of GSH glutathione, the body's master's antioxidant, the body can produce more white blood cells. Glutathione depletion will eventually exhaust any ability of the white blood cells to keep fighting, which means: You loose the battle.</p>
								
								<p>The presence of glutathione is required to maintain the normal function of the immune system. It is known to play a critical role in the multiplication of lymphocytes (the cells that mediate specific immunity), which occurs in the development of an effective immune response.</p>
								<p>Utilization of Glutathione GSH. Research has shown that individuals who have low levels of glutathione are susceptible to chronic illness. Research shows that GSH levels (glutathione) decline by 8% to 12% per decade, beginning at the age of 20. Levels of glutathione are further reduced by continual stress upon the immune system such as illness, infection, and environmental toxins. As we now know, a lowered immune system can bring about illness and disease. This is a ferocious cycle. While you need glutathione for a productive immune system, a weakened immune system hampers the production of glutathione. Supplements containing Glutathione Will NOT increase the body's GSH Levels. It is pointless to purchase glutathione, because the digestive system breaks down ingested glutathione and it will not be absorbed into your system.</p>
								<p>Glutathione binds itself to toxins in the body transforming them into a form that can be easily collected and extracted. Glutathione has also shown promise when used in connection with some forms of cancer. In both preliminary research and test tube and animal studies, glutathione has shown to exhibit anti-cancer effects. Higher glutathione levels have also been found in older adults with exceptionally good health.</p>
								<p>Low levels of glutathione (along with low levels of vitamin E and selenium) may be a factor in the genesis of thyroid disease. Excessive intake of sugars and starches may reduce glutathione and thereby damage the thyroid gland. In this study of patients with type 2 diabetes, blood levels of two vital nutrients - glutathione and vitamin E - were found to increase when glucose levels dropped and blood sugar became better controlled.</p>
								<p><strong>Glutathione Intravenous with Vitamin C: Best Skin Whitening Procedure</strong></p>
								<p>Glutathione IV injection taken along with Vitamin C is the most effective and the best skin whitening procedure. You get a much younger looking fairer skin with an amazing glow. Glutathione actually reduces melanin stimulation and pigmentation of the skin leading to white skin tone or color. Effects of skin whitening depend on how much pigmentation is there on the skin. You can see visible changes in the skin tone after the third or fourth session of IV Glutathione injection.</p>
								<p><strong>What is Glutathione Injection?</strong></p>
								<p>Glutathione IV is an anti-oxidant naturally present in our body at the time we are born. However, as we grow older the supply of Glutathione reduces as it is used up by our body in cell metabolism. The usage of Glutathione IV injection rejuvenates these cells in our body. This leads to a noticeably fairer complexion, firm and youthful sin. It also aids liver cells to regenerate from damages that are caused by prolonged alcohol abuse or intake of fatty food.</p>
								<p><strong>Glutathione IV injection or orally?</strong></p>
								<p>Glutathione IV injections are better and more effective compared to taking it orally. If you take Glutathione orally, the drug is broken down by stomach acids and just 20 percent of the active part of the drug is absorbed by the body. Compared to oral intake, Glutathione Injections take though injections tend to be far more effective as 100 percent of it is absorbed automatically.</p>
								<p>Glutathione needs Vitamin C for better and more long-lasting action. When taken along with Vitamin C, Glutathione can make the skin considerable fairer, firmer and much younger looking.</p>
								<p><strong>What are the side effects of Glutathione IV with Vitamin C?</strong></p>
								<p>People who are above 27 years of age can take IV Glutathione injections. Do not self-administer Glutathione IV injections on your own. This is strictly the work of a professional. Administration of Glutathione IV injection by a trained professional like a doctor is highly recommended. It is a 100 percent safe process but if a person who does not know how to use it, does it on herself or himself, there is a risk of problem like infection, stroke and heart disease.</p>
								
								<p>Medical Professionals on the Benefits of Glutathione</p>
								<p>Dr. Earl Mindell - "We literally cannot survive without this miraculous antioxidant" Glutathione (GSH) : Your Body's Most Powerful Healing Agent</p>
								<p>Patrick J.D. Bouic, Ph.D - "No other antioxidant is as important to overall health as glutathione. It is the regenerator of immune cells and the most valuable detoxifying agent in the body. Low levels are associated with early aging and even death."</p>
								<p>Dr. Allan Somersall, Ph.D., M.D. with Dr. Gustavo Bounous, M.D. - "Without glutathione, other important antioxidants such as vitamins C and E cannot do their job adequately to protect your body against disease." Breakthrough in Cell Defense</p>
								<p>Dr. Paul Cheney - "Glutathione has potent anti-viral properties - if you raise the glutathione level you can stop the replication of most any, at least, intracellular pathogen....but glutathione deficiency produces a pro-viral effect."</p>
								<p>Dr. Jimmy Gutman, MD - "Healthy people also benefit from elevated glutathione levels through an enhanced ability to fight off toxins, infectious disease, pre-cancerous cells and the aging process itself. Many world-class athletes are discovering that well-maintained glutathione levels give them the edge over their competitors, bringing greater strength and endurance, decreased recovery time from injury, less muscle pain and fatigue, and muscle-promoting activity."

								<p>"The liver is the major storehouse for glutathione. Glutathione is impaired in alcoholic hepatitis as well as in viral hepatitis A, B, and C. Raised glutathione levels restore liver function." - American Journal of Gasteroenterology 91: 2569-2573, 1996</p>
								<p>"Glutathione detoxifies a variety of pollutants, carcinogens and poisons, including many found in fuel exhaust and cigarette smoke. It also retards damage from radiation exposure due to the eroding ozone layer" . - Annual Reviews of Biochemistry 52: 711-760 1983</p>
								<p>"Raised glutathione levels help increase strength and endurance. Those interested in physical fitness can benefit from a definite athletic edge." Journal of Applied Physiology 87: 1381-1385, 1999</p>
								<p>"Strong muscular activity, such as that experienced by athletes, generates oxyradicals [free radicals] leading to muscle fatigue and poorer performance. Glutathione neutralizes these radicals". - Sport Medicine 21: 213-238, 1996</p>
								<p>"Lymphocytes, cells vital for your immune system, depend on glutathione for their proper function and replication." - IMMUNOLOGY 61: 503-508 1987</p>
								<p>"Antioxidants are well documented and known to possess vital roles in health maintenance and disease prevention. Glutathione is your cell's own major antioxidant. Maintaining elevated glutathione levels aids the body's natural antioxidant function." - Biochemical Pharmacology 47: 2113-2123 1994</p>

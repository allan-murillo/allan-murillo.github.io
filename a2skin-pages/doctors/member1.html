After being a registered nurse for seventeen years, she completed Master of Science in Nursing at Regis University with an emphasis on Family Nurse Practitioner in the year 2009. Through the years, she has always been interested in the field of Aesthetic and Wellness Medicine and thus, has entered various training and certifications in this field. Advanced Practice Nursing has strengthened her yearning for delivering an extraordinary and individualized care to patients and their families. In her role as a nurse practitioner, Arleen has assisted patients with weight management and in developing lifestyle changes that result in improved nutrition for longterm wellness rather than merely "dieting" for weight loss. Through her medical subspecialty experience, she has witnessed the positive outcomes of preventive medicine. She is also passionate about skin care and aesthetic medicine has expanded her vision in giving advanced, non-invasive multiple skin treatments and procedures which are safe and effective to all ages, genders and ethnicities.

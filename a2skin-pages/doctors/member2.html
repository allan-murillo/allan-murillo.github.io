		Agnes completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree in the Philippines in the year 1995 and immediately worked as a registered nurse in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before moving to the U.S. in 2003. Since 2005, she has worked as a Geriatric Psychiatric charge nurse. All these years, Agnes has always been interested in Aesthetic Medicine and continuously attending various professional trainings in this field. She helped Arleen, with the expertise of Dr. Sorina Simion-Rodgers, an Aesthetic and Anti-Aging Physician for more than 20 years, in developing a MedSpa in which the priority is client safety and with the mission to provide high-end, medical grade laser hair removal, skin treatments, medium to deep chemical peels and skin products, and other wellness services at an affordable price in a comfortable environment. Thus, A2 Skin MedSpa was born out of a collaboration RN and NP, which utilizes only the best and most innovative, latest-in-technology laser equipment, safe and effective medical grade skin care products and chemical peels.
